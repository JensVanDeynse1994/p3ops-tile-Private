The goal of this repository is to save all my (Jens Van Deynse) files for the course 'Project III: Systeembeheer'. This means that all files that I contribute or have used in orde to accomplish the exercises goal will also be in this repository.
Next to all this there will also be some folders containing the logs per week.
